### Profile {#profile}

Creative, patient, battle-tested developer with over 12 years of experience building, maintaining, and
scaling software for the web. A proud generalist and autodidact who prefers small,
focused, nimble teams that work smart and minimize friction in the dev process
(TDD, gitflow, continuous deployment.) Currently looking to join a dev team
that will challenge and inspire me, one where I can write code that I'm proud
of while building a product that I love.

  experience finding and fixing bottlenecks in critical-path code (e.g. hand-crafting crucial SQL queries,
  adding caching/memoization.)

* Linux Sysadmin/Operations

  webapp with near 100% uptime.  Significant experience designing and deploying
  load-balanced clusters of HTTP servers and caches using haproxy, nginx, unicorn,
  memcached, and redis. Etsy "Measure Everything" fanboy.
